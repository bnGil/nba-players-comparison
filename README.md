# NBA Players Comparison

## Description

As an NBA fan I thought it would be nice and challenging to build an NBA players comparison website.

The purpose of the website is to compare both statistics and people's opinion about them.
You can compare two players or the same player at different seasons and also read and write what you think of him.

Use this website to build your fantasy league!

## Main Technologies:

- React - Functional components, context and custom hooks
- Cloud Functions - CRA exposes env variables, Therefore I used Netlify Functions in order to hide secrets such as API keys
- Firebase - To store comments
- API of NBA statistics
  <br>
  <br>

## Packages:

- Chart.js for React
- react-select
  <br>
  <br>

## Future Features:

- Login - to allow building a personal fantasy league and store it
- More comment features such as likes and etc
